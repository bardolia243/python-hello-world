## Introduction

This repository serves as a simple demonstration of using GitHub Actions to automate tasks. In this case, the workflow prints "Hello, World!" using a Python script.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file. It contains a simple job that executes a Python script to print "Hello, World!"

```yaml
name: Hello World

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Run Python Script
      run: python hello_world.py


Usage
